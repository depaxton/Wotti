  "rules": [
    "Write everything in English: code, comments, commit messages, filenames, and documentation.",
    "Use only colors defined in style.css starting from the comment /* X- Color Palette */. Do not introduce new color values, inline styles, or extra palette definitions.",
    "Respect existing architecture and conventions. Extend the current structure instead of inventing a new one, unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign.",
    "Before creating any function, component, or module, choose the best folder and file location for long term maintainability, clarity, and scalability.",
    "Use clear, descriptive English names. Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and classes, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.",
    "Keep strict separation of concerns. Structure and markup live in components or views, styling in CSS or preprocessor files, and business logic in dedicated modules or services.",
    "Each function, component, or module should have a single responsibility and remain small, focused, and easy to test.",
    "Avoid duplicate logic. When functionality is reused or likely to be reused, extract it into shared utilities, hooks, or services that fit the project structure.",
    "Organize the project into clear domains and layers where relevant, such as components, pages, hooks, services, api, utils, assets, config, and tests.",
    "Prefer composition over inheritance and prefer pure, side effect free functions where possible.",
    "Treat error handling as essential. Validate inputs, handle edge cases, and provide meaningful error messages and safe fallbacks for both users and developers.",
    "Design code for testability. When the stack allows, structure logic so it can be covered by automated tests and avoid tight coupling to frameworks.",
    "Follow performance best practices. Avoid unnecessary re renders, repeated heavy computations, and redundant network calls. Use memoization, caching, and lazy loading only when they clearly help.",
    "Follow accessibility best practices. Use semantic HTML, meaningful labels, keyboard navigation support, and adequate contrast using only the approved color palette.",
    "Do not hard code values that may change, such as base URLs, feature limits, and keys. Move them into constants, configuration files, or environment variables.",
    "Be careful with security. Validate and sanitize external data, avoid exposing secrets in the client, and never inject untrusted HTML without proper escaping.",
    "Keep imports clean and stable. Group them logically, remove unused imports and dead code, and avoid temporary debug code in committed files.",
    "Write comments only when they explain intent, design decisions, or complex reasoning. Code should be self explanatory through clear structure and naming.",
    "Follow modern JavaScript or TypeScript best practices, including modules, async or await, immutability for state, and clear separation between data, state, and UI.",
    "When creating or changing APIs, keep backward compatibility in mind. Avoid breaking changes to existing public interfaces unless explicitly requested and documented.",
    "Think about future growth for every new feature. Choose patterns and abstractions that can be extended without major refactoring.",
    "Keep UI and UX consistent. Reuse existing components, patterns, and spacing rules instead of creating slightly different versions of the same idea.",
    "Be mindful of bundle size and dependencies. Avoid adding heavy libraries when the same result can be achieved with existing tools or small helpers.",
    "Any new folder, file, function, or component must make the project easier to understand for future developers and should fit naturally into the existing structure.",
    "All code generated by the AI must obey these rules by default, and any suggestion that breaks them should be explicitly justified in comments or description."
